    <br>Here are steps to building a shelter using natural materials found in a forest environment:</p>

<ol class="directions">
    <li><strong>Select a site -</strong> Choose somewhere relatively flat, free of lose rocks, close to a source of drinking water and wood for building/burning. Try to avoid being hit by strong winds and away from bugs.
    <li><strong>The bed -</strong> Don't sleep on the ground because it will make your body lose heat! Instead, elevate yourself above the ground using logs. Then add a layer of bedding made from boughs/leaves/grass.
    <li><strong>The shelter frame-</strong> Using big sticks to build with, create an angled pitch to avoid rain/snow leaking in. Next, insulate the whole surface/in between any cracks with boughs of evergreen trees/grass/moss/bark etc. 
</ol>
