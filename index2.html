<h1 class="shelter">SHELTER</h1>
<p id="p">When you go camping, you likely bring a tent to use as a shelter. But if you find yourself in an emergency survivial situation, there are many ways to build a shelter yourself using natural materials!  <br><br>
<img id="shelter-pic" src="https://www.americanoutdoor.guide/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ASGFM-1604-SHELTER-05.jpg" width=400px> <br>Here are steps to building a shelter using natural materials found in a forest environment:</p>

<ol class="directions">
    <li><strong>Select a site -</strong> Choose somewhere relatively flat, free of lose rocks, close to a source of drinking water and wood for building/burning. Try to avoid being hit by strong winds and away from bugs.
    <li><strong>The bed -</strong> Don't sleep on the ground because it will make your body lose heat! Instead, elevate yourself above the ground using logs. Then add a layer of bedding made from boughs/leaves/grass.
    <li><strong>The shelter frame -</strong> Using big sticks to build with, create an angled pitch to avoid rain/snow leaking in. Look at the pictures to see the different frame styles!
    <li><strong>Insulation -</strong> Finally, insulate the whole surface/in between any cracks with boughs of evergreen trees/grass/moss/bark etc. And if you have one, use a tarp to cover the frame so that no rain/snow can leak in.
</ol>
