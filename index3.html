    <br>Here are some steps to making a controlled fire:</p>

<ol class="feu">
    <li><strong>Carefully select a site -</strong> Make sure its sheltered from the elements such as rain, wind and snow so the fire doesn't get put out. The site should also be away from anything flammable like overhanging branches, roots, etc.
    <li><strong>Start the flame -</strong> Some fire starting tools include: a lighter, matches, a flint striker, or a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bcoutdoorsmagazine.com/fire-by-friction-learning-the-art-of-the-fire-bow/">fire bow </a>. Use the fire starting tool to create embers with tinder (fluffy, dead, dry plant material like birch bark, cattails, grasses, etc.)
    <li><strong>Build with kindling/maintaining -</strong> After you have a small flame burning off of the tinder, add in small pieces of kindling (small twigs, sticks that increase in thickness)
    <li><strong>Putting the fire out -</strong> Stop adding fuel to the fire and after a while it'll start to go down. To quickly extinguish the flame, drown it with water. Mix the embers with soil and dirt, making sure it's wet so the fire doesn't start again.
