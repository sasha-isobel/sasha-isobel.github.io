        <div class="intro"><p id="p">My name is Sasha and I love the outdoors! I go camping every summer with my family and friends. My favourite things to do while camping are swimming in the lake, hiking and canoeing/kayaking. Also, I used to do Girl Guides where we went on lots of cool sleepover trips and I learned many outdoor skills! Lastly, I like watching shows such as <em>Survivor</em> and <em>Survivorman</em> because they're in the nature. <br>Here are a few my favourite provincial/national parks that I've visited:</p>
        <ul class="parks">
            <li>Bon Echo - <em>Ontario Provincial Park</em>
            <li>Killbear - <em>Ontario Provincial Park</em>
            <li>Thingvellir - <em>Icelandic National Park</em>
            <li>Silent Lake - <em>Ontario Provincial Park</em>
        </ul>
