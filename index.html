        <h1 id="tourism">Visit Iceland!</h1>
        <p>Travel Webpage by Sasha Vila Rumszewicz <br> <br>Iceland is a unique <strong>nordic</strong> island, popular for its <em>breathtaking</em> natural beauty. It's often referred to as the "Land of Fire and Ice" thanks to the glaciers and volcanoes that can be found throughout the country. <br>
        Because of it's very northern location, the sun shines over Iceland for most of the day in the summer, but the island is in darkness for more than half of the day during winter. This makes it possible to see the stunning northern lights in the fall, winter and spring.</p>

        <p><strong>See/swim in geothermal hot springs</strong><br>
        Many hikes pass by small remote natural hot springs that you can actually swim in for free! Even though the air is cold, the rivers naturally steam and have geothermally heated water.</p><br>
